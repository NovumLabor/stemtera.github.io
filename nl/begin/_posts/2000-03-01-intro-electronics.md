There are many books and tutorials that you can learn electronics from. This guide is not one of them. This is specifically written to introduce you to the fun of making simple electronic circuits with the (STMB) without having to read 1000 pages of text. Once you get the hang of making disco lights and buzzing Mario's theme song with the (STMB), and still want to have more electronics fun by reading a 1040 page book, [Practical Electronics for Inventors by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071771336) is well worth a read.

But before making our first electronic circuit,  we need quickly explorer the basic of electronics in this chapter so that at least the fundamentals can be conveyed easily.
