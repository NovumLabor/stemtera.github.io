## What is Arduino?

![Arduino Uno R3](/img/arduino_uno.svg){: .eighth-w .left }Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.

## What is (STMB)?

(STMB) is a smart electronic breadboard with an Arduino UNO R3 compatible built inside. It is specifically designed to solve the following common issues using Arduino with a breadboard especially in the lab or classroom.

* Reduce the headache of managing students' messy wires flying around microcontroller board and breadboard during class.
* Enhance the current design (Arduino UNO) for native USB development without changing or adding extra components.
* Improve adaptability, mountability and protection, enabling more projects to be built in the lab or classroom.

## Hardware

![(STMB) Block Diagram](/img/stemtera_breadboard_block_diagram.svg){: .quarter-w .left }Just like an Arduino UNO, the (STMB) has two micro-controllers soldered on the PCB (Printed Circuit Board). The ATMEL's ATmega32U2 and the ATmega328P. The ATmega32U2 serves as the bridge for USB communication between the computer and the ATmega328P. 

In a normal Arduino UNO, this USB bridge only act as a bridge because the extra physical pins are not exposed. The (STMB) exposed all these extra pins to the breadboard's tie points, allowing native USB projects to be built.
