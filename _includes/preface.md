**(STMB)** was created with the help from thousands of [backers on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stemtera/stemtera-breadboard-arduino-compatible-built-in-br/community) and distributors like [SparkFun Electronics](https://www.sparkfun.com), [LittleBird Electronics](https://littlebirdelectronics.com.au) and [ITEAD Studio](http://itead.cc). Without them, this awesome piece of work will not be available today.<br/><br/>*January 1st, 2017 - JP Liew*
