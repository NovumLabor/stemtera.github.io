## Voltage

**Voltage** is the pressure or force from an electrical circuit's power source that "pushes" charged electrons through conductors. The greater the **voltage**, the greater is its ability to "push" the electrons through a given circuit. **Voltage** is also called **potential**. The difference in voltage between any two points or terminals in a circuit is known as the **potential difference**, commonly called the **voltage drop**. There are two different voltages, AC (alternating current) voltage and DC (direct current) voltage. AC flows in both directions and is commonly used in electrical wall plug. DC flows in one direction and is commonly used by battery operated circuits. By using a special circuit, AC can be coverted into DC and vice versa. In this guide, we will only be learning circuits in DC.

## Resistance

Electrons move through a conductor when electric current flows. All material impede flow of electric current to some extend. Some materials hold their electrons very tightly, and due to this, **electrons** will not move through them very well. These materials are called insulators. Rubber, plastic, cloth and dry air are good insulators. Materials that allow many electrons to flow freely are called conductors, examples are, copper, silver, aluminium, hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and saltwater. The characteristic of materials impede flow of electric current is called resistance.  Insulators have high resistance and conductors have low resistance and resistance is measured in Ohms (Î©).

![How to Measure Voltage](img/measure_voltage.svg){: .half-w .center }

The unit for voltage or potential difference is volt with a symbol V or E. By using a multimeter, turn the mulimeter's knob to the *voltage* range. Touch the RED (positive) probe on one of the point and the BLACK (negative) probe to the other point. If the reading shows a negative number, this means the point where the BLACK probe is has higher potential. The display tells you the *potential difference* (voltage) of the two points in Volts.

If your multimeter is not an auto-ranging multimeter, always set the range to the highest first, then work downwards until the desired reading is achieved.
